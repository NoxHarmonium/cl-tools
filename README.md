cl-tools
========

Command line tools I use for my various coding projects.

Very much only for personal use at the moment. I hope to clean it up a bit and maybe make it useful to other people. 

I release all code contained within this respository that I authored to be public domain. It would be nice if you let me know if my code has helped you out though.
